/*
  This comment describes the idea behind what InitChunkSize() is supposed to do,
  and how it relates to the purpose of class UtteranceSplitter.

  Class UtteranceSplitter is supposed to tell us, for a given utterance length,
  what chunk sizes to use.  The chunk sizes it may choose are:
    - zero or more chunks of the 'principal' size (the first-listed value in
      --num-frames option)
    - at most two chunks of 'alternative' num-frames (meaning, any but the
      first-listed choice in the --num-frames option).

  (note: an empty list of chunks is not allowed as a split).  A split is
  a list of chunk-sizes in increasing order (we when we actually split the
  utterance into chunks, we may, at random, reverse the order.

  The choice of split to use for a given utterance-length is determined as
  follows.  Firstly, for each split we compute a 'default duration' (see
  DefaultDurationOfSplit()... if --num-frames-overlap is zero, this is just the
  sum of the chunk sizes).  We then use by a cost-function that depends on
  default-duration and the length of the utterance: the idea is that these two
  should be as close as possible, but penalizing the default-duration being
  larger than the utterance-length (which in the normal case of
  --num-frames-overlap=0 would lead to gaps between the segments), twice as much
  as the other sign of difference.

  Specifically:
    cost(default_duration, utt_length) = (default_duration > utt_length ?
                                         default_duration - utt_length :
                                         2.0 * (utt_length - default_duration))
  [but as a special case, set c to infinity if the largest chunk size in the
   split is longer than the utterance length; we couldn't, in that case, use
   this split for this utterance].

  We want to make sure a good variety of combinations of chunk sizes are chosen
  in case there are ties from the cost function.  For each utterance length
  we store the set of splits, whose costs are within 2
  of the best cost available for that utterance length.  When asked to find
  chunks for a particular utterance of that length, we will choose randomly
  from that pool of splits.
